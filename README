## Command-line usage

- Install `littler` and `EnsemblGenomes` in `R`

```sh
Rscript -e "BiocManager::install(c('littler', 'EnsemblGenomes'))"
```

- Make symlinks to `r` (from `littler`) and to `list_ensembl_files` (from `EnsemblGenomes`)

```sh
ln -s `Rscript -e "cat(.libPaths()[1])"`/littler/bin/r ~/.local/bin/
ln -s `Rscript -e "cat(.libPaths()[1])"`/EnsemblGenomes/bin/list_ensembl_files ~/.local/bin/
ln -s `Rscript -e "cat(.libPaths()[1])"`/EnsemblGenomes/bin/list_ensembl_species ~/.local/bin/
```

- Enjoy :)

```sh
list_ensembl_species fungi | head
list_ensembl_files plasmodium_vivax
```
