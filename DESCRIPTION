Title: Rapid access to Ensembl-provided genome reference and annotation files
Description: EnsemblGenomes scrapes [ensembl.org] and [ensemblgenomes.org] FTP 
    servers to locate genome reference fasta files and genome annotation 
    gff3 files provided for species supported by Ensembl. As of July 2024, 
    this corresponds to more than 300 vertebrate, 300 metazoa, 200 protists, 
    150 plants, 1,000 fungi and 30,000 bacteria species. Rather than supporting
    `BiocFileCache`, EnsemblGenomes simply intends to retrieve and list URL 
    of fasta and gff3 files across Ensembl releases as a plain data frame.
